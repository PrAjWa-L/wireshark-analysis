Network Traffic Protocol Analysis Report

Total Packets Captured: 487

1. DNS (Domain Name System)
- Filter Used: dns
- Purpose: Resolve domain names into IP addresses.
- Findings:
  - Total Packets: 29 (6.0% of capture)
  - Standard queries sent to DNS servers like 8.8.8.8
  - Responses include resolved IPs for domains such as archlinux.org
  - Indicates normal web browsing or service lookup behavior.

2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- Filter Used: tcp
- Purpose: Core transport layer protocol for reliable communication.
- Findings:
  - Total Packets: 253 (52.0% of capture)
  - Includes 3-way handshakes (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK)
  - Used in HTTP, TLS, and other application-layer traffic

3. TLS (Transport Layer Security)

- Filter Used: tls
- Purpose: Secure encrypted communication over HTTPS.
- Findings:
  - Total Packets: 49 (10.1% of capture)
  - TLS handshake observed with Client Hello and Server Hello
  - Cipher suites negotiated successfully
  - Suggests access to encrypted web content (e.g., HTTPS websites)

4. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

- Filter Used: icmp || icmpv6
- Purpose: Diagnostic messages (e.g., ping, unreachable errors).
- Findings:
  - ICMPv4: 30 packets (6.2%)
  - ICMPv6: 52 packets (10.7%)
  - Echo requests/replies suggest connectivity tests

5. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- Filter Used: arp
- Purpose: Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses on the local network.
- Findings:
  - 48 packets (9.9%)
  - Broadcasts like "Who has 192.168.18.1?"
  - Normal local traffic for device discovery

6. mDNS & SSDP (Multicast/Service Discovery)
- Filters: udp.port == 5353 (mDNS), ssdp
- Purpose: Discover devices/services (printers, smart TVs) on LAN.
- Findings:
  - mDNS: 16 packets (3.3%) — Multicast DNS traffic
  - SSDP: 4 packets (0.8%) — Universal Plug and Play discovery

7. Apache JServ Protocol v1.3 (AJP13)

- Filter Used: tcp.port == 8009 or protocol contains ajp13
- Purpose: Backend communication in Java/Tomcat web apps.
- Findings:
  - 4 packets (0.8%)
  - Indicates use of Java server-based communication
